# Streamflow Joyplot Tool

<img src="https://github.com/codeswitching/Streamflow-Joyplot-Tool/blob/master/plots/shinyapp.PNG">

A shiny app that creates joyplots of stream hydrology using data from USGS NWIS. Useful for showing changes in discharge patterns over time, the effects of dams, wet vs dry years, upstream vs downstream characteristics, timing of snowpack melting, etc. API connection and Colorado River example inspired by @jfleck.

*streamflow analysis.R* shows how to fetch NWIS data and provides examples of ridgeplots using ggridges and 3d heatmaps using the renderer library.
